## Challenges 
I faced a few challenges during this project. Firstly, while I had a general idea of how I wanted to clean the database and what queries I wanted to run, I struggled with executing them correctly using SQL and pgAdmin. I had a fair amount of trial and error trying to format using correct sytax and proper ordering, and find the correct commands. Stack Overflow and Postgresql Tutorial, alongside other information from the weeks lessons was very helpful. 

Another challenge was that many of the variables across the datasets had similar names.  While some were the same variable and needed to be cleaned, others such as product_price and unit_price were confusing.  For certain questions, I had to make assumptions and then justify my use of a variable that made the most sense to generate a query. One example would be the inclusion of both product_price and unit_price in the products and analytics datasets. I determined that product_price would be the direct amount a customer would pay and would account for other costs such as discounts or shipping, whereas the unit price from analytics would be just the base price of the physical product without anything else considered. Therefore, I used product price to generate revenue. However, it is possible that without accurate information or a descripton of each variable,  even correct queries could retrieve incorrect data.

Finally, I had to prioritize completing each task to a sufficient level, and therefore I did not have enough time to conduct as in-depth data cleaning and analysis as I would have liked. Although I was not able to clean the database as thoroughly as I would have preferred, I documented the data cleaning steps that I had completed and identified what additional work I would have liked to do. If this had been a team project or a professional work environment where I had been reassigned, I would have hoped that my documentation provided enough detail for someone else to pick up where I left off.
