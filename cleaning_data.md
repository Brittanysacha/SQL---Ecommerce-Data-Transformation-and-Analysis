<!-- What issues will you address by cleaning the data?
When cleaning the dataset, I wanted to check for a range of potential data issues including:

-	Missing or incomplete data
-	Duplicate entries
-	Incorrect data types
-	Outliers or extreme values
-	Inconsistent formatting or naming conventions -->

<!-- To begin to address these issues, I wanted to perform a range of data cleaning tasks, including: -->

<!-- I would start by reviewing outliers, imputing NULL for missing values, and then running the following code for each integer across my tables to identify rows that are more than 3 standard deviations away from the mean. --> -->

-	Removing rows or columns with missing or incomplete data.
-	Removing duplicate entries.
-	Converting data types to the appropriate formats (i.e. converting certain numbers to strings â€“ such as phone numbers ).
-	Standardizing formatting or naming conventions (i.e. using M.
